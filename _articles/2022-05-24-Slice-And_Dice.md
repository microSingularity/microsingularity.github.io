Version 1.1 of the [Slice and Dice](https://blendermarket.com/products/slice-and-dice) add-on has been released on Blender Market. This addon now includes support for Italian and Spanish languages in Blender as well as now supporting Blender version 3.0.

If you haven't seen or used the add-on yet, I encourage you to check-out the trailer here:

I have also prepared a tutorial video demonstrating the main features of Slice and Dice and how to integrate them into your modeling workflow.
