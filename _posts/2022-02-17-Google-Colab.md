Since starting my Youtube channel, a little over a year ago, I've published a lot of tutorials on the topic of speeding up Blender renders with Google Colab. It can be a bit confusing which tutorial covers what subject so I'm going to give a quick summary of each tutorial here.

## First Colab Tutorial - Origins

In my first Google Colab tutorial, I demonstrated how to render your blender scenes on the cloud using a simpple python script. Since making this tutorial, I found a way to do the same task but without the python script. However, this tutorial is still worth watching if you have made your Blender scene using an AMD graphics card on your local PC. Some people have commented that the python script is still necessary in this case.

## Rendering Animations on Google Colab

In the second Google Colab tutorial that I published, I demonstrated how to render animations on the cloud and without the need for an additional python script (for NVidia GPU users).

## Blender - Cycles X

This is still probably the most relevant of the tutorials since it shows you how to download and install Blender 3.0 with Cycles-X and render your Blender scenes on the cloud. It also includes a helpful FAQ chapter on some of the most common issues running Blender on Google Colab.

## How to Install Blender Addons on Google Colab

In this tutorial I demonstrated how to install third party addons in Blender running on Google Colab. This enabled people to render there Blender Scenes even if it required addons.

## How to Bake Fluids on Google Colab

In this tutorial I demonstrated how to either render fluids that have been baked on another PC by transferring the cache to Google Colab or bake the fluids directly on the cloud. Although, as I discuss in the tutorial, I don't reccomend baking fluids on Google Colab as it currently only uses a single CPU and as usually slower than just baking it locally.

## Fixing Google Colab CUDA Errors

After publishing the earlier tutorials, Google seemed to have made some changes to the default environment on Google Colab which runs the python scripts. As a result Blender was no longer able to use the GPU provided by Google. This tutorial explains how to fix the issue.

## Rendering your Blender Scenes when you Sleep

In this quick tutorial, I show you how to stop your Google Colab session from closing if you don't interact with the console for a short period of time. This enables you to run your Blender renders for extended periods of time without constantly checking your PC.

## Rendering your Blender Scenes on Kaggle

Although this tutorial on how to Render your Blender scenes was extreemely popular due to the higher specifications of Kaggles free GPUs, Kaggle appears to have blocked Blender from being installed on their platform. I decided to remove the tutorial from my channel as a result, but it is still available here in-case it is still useful to someone.
