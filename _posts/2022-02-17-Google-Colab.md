Since starting my Youtube channel, a little over a year ago, I've published a lot of tutorials on the topic of speeding up Blender renders with Google Colab. It can be a bit confusing which tutorial covers what subject so I'm going to give a quick summary of each tutorial here.

## First Colab Tutoral - Origins

In my first Google Colab tutorial, I demonstrated how to render your blender scenes on the cloud using a simpple python script. Since making this tutorial, I found a way to do the same task but without the python script. However, this tutorial is still worth watching if you have made your Blender scene using an AMD graphics card on your local PC. Some people have commented that the python script is still necessary in this case.

## Rendering Animations on Google Colab

In the second Google Colab tutorial that I published, I demonstrated how to render animations on the cloud and without the need for an additional python script (for NVidia GPU users).

## Blender - Cycles X

This is still probably the most relevant of the tutorials since it shows you how to download and install Blender 3.0 with Cycles-X and render your Blender scenes on the cloud. It also includes a helpful FAQ chapter on some of the most common issues running Blender on Google Colab.

## How to Install Blender Addons on Google Colab

In this tutorial I demonstrated how to install third party addons in Blender running on Google Colab. This enabled people to render there Blender Scenes even if it required addons.
